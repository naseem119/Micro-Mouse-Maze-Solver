# Micro-Mouse-Maze-Solver
This is a micro mouse maze solver using an optimized left-hand rule to avoid endless loops and unnecessary paths, refining its approach on the second run. Designed for a 25x25 cm maze, it uses 2 DC motors, 2 encoders, 3 IR sensors, 2 ultrasonic sensors, an H-bridge, and an Arduino Uno. all Details are in: trello.com/b/mOyeIbLY/interface-project
