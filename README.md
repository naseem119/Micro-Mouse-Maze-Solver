# Micro-Mouse-Maze-Solver
This project features a micro mouse maze solver that implements an optimized left-hand rule. The algorithm avoids endless loops and unnecessary paths, refining its approach on the second run to find the shortest path (though it may not always achieve the optimal solution). The maze solver is designed for a 25x25 cm maze and is built using the following components:

2 DC motors
2 encoders
3 IR sensors
2 ultrasonic sensors
1 H-bridge
Arduino Uno
In addition to the robot body kit, the building process and a comprehensive list of components are documented in the Trello board linked below:\n
